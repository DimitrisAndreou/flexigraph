/**
 * Implementation of disjoint-set data structure, providing merge(merge)/find operations, in
 * order to be able to track whether two elements belong in the same set or not, and
 * to efficiently merge two sets.
 *
 * <p>The set that contains a particular element {@code e} (of type {@code Partition}
 * is accessed by {@code e.find()}.
 * Note that the returned set is merely an element itself, which is used as a representative of
 * the set. So, if two elements have the same representative, they belong to the same set.
 * Otherwise, they belong to different sets. Note that the elements of a particular set cannot be
 * queried directly. Thus, perhaps confusingly, a {@code Partition} represents both a single
 * element <em>and</em> potentially a set of elements, in the particular partition happens
 * to be chosen as the representative of its set.
 *
 * <p>A <em>partition</em> is initially {@link #singleton(Object) created as a singleton}.
 * It accepts an arbitrary (user-defined) value (of type {@code <E>})
 * that is permanently associated with the created partition, and can be accessed by {@link #value()}.
 * A created partition is independent from any other created partition. This means that the return value
 * of {@link #find()} is unique, and method {@link #areMerged(Partition, Partition)}
 * always returns false when given such a partition as an argument.
 *
 * <p>A partition {@code p1} may be <em>merged</em> with another partition {@code p2} by
 * {@code p1.merge(p2);} (or, equivalently, {@code p2.merge(p1);}). From that point on,
 * this invariant is created: {@code p1.find() == p2.find()} which remains true regardless of
 * other future merge operations. Similarly, {@code areMerged(p1, p2)} will always return {@code true}.
 *
 * <p>All methods throw {@code NullPointerException} if given {@code null} arguments.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of the arbitrary (user-defined) element associated with a partition
